# Music Genre Classification Using Multi-Class Support Vector Machines

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Music Genre Classification project based on Multi-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal of the project is to build a robust model capable of classifying music tracks into various genres using datasets like the GTZAN dataset for training and validation.

## Dataset

The GTZAN dataset is utilized for training and validating the SVM model. The dataset includes audio files from different genres, providing a diverse set of samples for effective model training.

## Features

- **SVM Model:** Implementation of a Multi-Class Support Vector Machines model for music genre classification.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Extraction of relevant audio features, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectral contrast, and chroma features.

- **Evaluation:** Performance evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are provided to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Results

Detailed results, including confusion matrices and classification reports, are available in the 'results' folder.

## Future Improvements

- Exploration of advanced feature extraction techniques.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal model performance.
- Integration of deep learning models for comparison.
